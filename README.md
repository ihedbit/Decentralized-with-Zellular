# Zellular-DApps

Welcome to **Zellular-DApps**, a collection of decentralized applications (dApps) built using [Zellular](https://docs.zellular.xyz), a decentralized sequencer designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant consensus and messaging.

## About

This repository contains examples and templates to help developers integrate Zellular into their projects. Whether you're building token systems, decentralized exchanges, or other blockchain-based solutions, these examples will guide you through using Zellular for decentralized sequencing and consensus.

## Projects

This repo contains smart contract examples demonstrating how to implement essential Ethereum standards and features using Zellular.

### 1. **Fungible Token Standard**

### 2. **Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Standard**

### 3. **Multi-Token Standard**

### 4. **Staking Contract**

### 5. **Liquidity Pool Contract**

### 6. **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**

### 7. **Cross-Chain Bridge**

### 8. **More Projects Coming Soon**


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ihedbit/Zellular-DApps.git
   cd Zellular-DApps
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Each project comes with its own set of instructions, found within the respective folder.

3. **Run the example**:
   Follow the project-specific instructions to deploy the smart contract on a local blockchain environment (such as Ganache) or on a testnet like Rinkeby.
